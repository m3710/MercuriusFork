This is a fork of [tuskyapp/Tusky](https://github.com/tuskyapp/Tusky)!
This fork was created at the 9th of july 2019.

## Description
### Original
Tusky is a beautiful Android client for [Mastodon](https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon). Mastodon is a GNU social-compatible federated social network. That means not one entity controls the whole network, rather, like e-mail, volunteers and organisations operate their own independent servers, users from which can all interact with each other seamlessly.
### This Fork
In addition, this fork supports free speech and wishes to promote the original idea behind the project - allowing ALL users to interact with each other, if they desire to do so.

## Features
### Original

- Drafts - compose toots and save them for later

### This Fork
